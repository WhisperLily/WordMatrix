Inspired by Scrabble, 
a python-based interactive word game that challenges players to unscramble randomly generated words. 
Applied object-oriented programming (OOP) to design modular and reusable components for game logic, word management, 
and user interaction. Integrated features such as scrambled word generation, player score tracking, 
and replay functionality. Future updates may include difficulty scaling, and AI-driven hints
